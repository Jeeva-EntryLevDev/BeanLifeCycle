Problem 5: Logger Utility Injection
You are building an application where multiple components (e.g., UserService, OrderService) need to log messages.
 Design a shared Logger class and inject it into the services using annotation-based DI.

MY PLAN
Logger Class --> log(String message) [used : @Component]
UserService ---> Logger injected --> processUser()  --> log(msg) called [used : @Component, @Autowire]
OrderService --> logger injected -->  --> processOrder() --> log(msg) called [used : @Component, @Autowire]

AppConfig class --> @Configuration, @ComponentScan
MainApp class --> 
	AnnotationConfigApplicationContext object
	.getBean --> UserService object 
	.getbean --> OrderService object 
	i'll call both objects startLog()

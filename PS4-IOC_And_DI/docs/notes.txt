ðŸ§© Problem 4: Student & Course Registration

A Student object should depend on a Course object. The Course should be injected using setter-based DI. Demonstrate how Spring handles this.

âœ… What Youâ€™ll Use
	@Component for beans
	@Autowired on setter method
	Spring context configuration via @ComponentScan


X
private final Course course;

You cannot use final with setter injection, because final fields must be assigned only once, 
and setter injection happens after object creation â€” too late for final.

âœ… 
private Course course;
Here's what happens internally:
	Spring creates a blank object of Student (calls constructor)
	Then, after object creation, it finds @Autowired on setCourse()	
	Then Spring injects the Course object by calling setCourse(...)

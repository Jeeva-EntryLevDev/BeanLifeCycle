ðŸ§© Problem 2: Multiple Beans Same Type
Create two beans of type Mobile (e.g., SamsungMobile, AppleMobile) with different implementations.
Demonstrate how to retrieve both beans and print which one was injected (using @Qualifier).

Mobile : Interface ---> displayInfo() method declared
SamsungMobile : Class implements Mobile --> displayInfo() @Component
AppleMobile : Class implements Mobile --> diplayInfo() @Component
Mobile --> @Autowired --> @Qualifier -->  

Note : Spring registers beans using their class names with camel case by default, so : registers a bean named "appleMobile" not "AppleMobile"

Mistake I've done 
(i) method names : Mobile --> specs, MobileBuying --> showSpecs
(ii) forget to add @Component in Applemobile
(iii) @Qualifier use --> camelCase

TIP: @primary You want a default bean --> 
	Eg : if you want SamsungMobile as default bean --> put @Primary below @Component 
if you want to override again use @Qualifier

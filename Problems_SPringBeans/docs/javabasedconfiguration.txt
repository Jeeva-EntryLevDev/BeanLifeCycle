Java Based Configuration 

don't need to put 
@ComponentScan 
@Component


Why Can We Skip @ComponentScan?
âœ” @ComponentScan is used when you rely on @Component, @Service, @Repository, or @Controller annotations to automatically detect beans in a package.
âœ” When using @Bean in a configuration class (@Configuration), Spring directly registers the beans, so manual scanning isn't required.

ðŸš€ When Do You Need @ComponentScan?
âœ… If you use @Component, @Service, or @Repository annotations, then @ComponentScan is required to detect them.

But in pure @Bean configuration, beans are manually defined inside methods, so Spring doesn't need to scan packages.


Java-Based Configuration vs. Annotation-Based Configuration : 
âœ” In Java-based configuration (@Configuration + @Bean), we explicitly define bean creation using @Bean methods:
	Imp : ðŸ”¹ We control exactly how objects are instantiated
	
âœ” In Annotation-based configuration (@Component + @ComponentScan), Spring automatically detects and creates beans, reducing manual bean definition
	Imp : ðŸ”¹ Spring scans components and instantiates them automatically using @ComponentScan.

Java Based Configuration : gives fine-grained control over how beans are instantiated.
Annotation-based configuration : Spring auto-manages beans using scanning.

When to Use Each?
âœ… Use @Bean when you need custom instantiation logic.
	âœ” You need custom bean properties set before creation.
	âœ” The bean comes from a third-party library that Spring can't scan.
	âœ” Bean creation depends on dynamic logic, like conditions or input values.
	
âœ… Use @ComponentScan when you want Spring to handle bean creation automatically.

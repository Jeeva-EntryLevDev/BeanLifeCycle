ðŸ§© Problem 3: External Bean Access
Define a bean DatabaseConfig that holds connection properties like URL, username, and password.
Access it in DatabaseService and simulate a connect operation.

Note : 
(i)better to keep the username url and password in private instance variable 
(ii) Always try to use Constructor injection mostly 
(iii) for the first point we can update the properties in application.properties --> src/main/resources

created in com.problem.usingapplicationproperty
@Value("${db.url}") above in every private property 
@PropertySource("classpath:application.properties")

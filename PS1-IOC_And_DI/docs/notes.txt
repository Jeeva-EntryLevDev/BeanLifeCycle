Preferrable : (Larger projects: where separation of concerns is important, When you have multiple config classes (e.g., DB config, Web config, Security config).)

Engine 
Car 
AppConfig --> @ComponentScan and @Configuration after it'll be empty class
MainClass --> AnnotationConfigApplicationContext, AppConfig Class


For small project : Ignore the MainClass Idea (especially for small test/demo projects)

Engine 
Car 
AppConfig --> @ComponentScan and @Configuration and AnnotationConfigApplicationContext, AppConfig Class


Car car = context.getBean(Car.class); // Why Car.class, not Engine.class?

"Hey Spring, give me an instance of this class â€” with all its dependencies injected properly."
"Spring, give me a Car object, and please inject an Engine object inside it automatically."
